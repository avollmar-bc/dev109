				<a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=14&coid=57598" target="_blank">Course detailes</a>
                 <p>What did you know before this class?<br>
				Before taking the class, I had a general understanding of: Basic HTML and CSS for creating simple web pages.
				I never use JavaScript. Had some awareness of web browsers, and SEO.  However have not used any of those knowledge. 
				</p><p>What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class? <br>
				Working with git, updated HTML knowledge, learn CSS and JavaScript basic and use all three in the webpage.  
				</p>

                <h2>Intro to Python Programming</h2>
				<strong>Dev109 | Dena Laney </strong><br>
				<a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=14&coid=58000" target="_blank">Course detailes</a>
                <p>What did you know before this class?<br>
				I knew nothing about Python. It is like learning ABC.  
				My knowledge of programming was nearly nonexistent. I had heard of programming. 
				languages like Python and knew it was used to create software and applications, 
				but the concept felt abstract and intimidating</p>
				<p>What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class?<br>
				I get concept of the vast majority of its use and 
				<br>
				I wish I could say that I became proficient in using variables to store and manipulate data, 
				and how they affect operations in a program. <br>
				Reality is that I see how much I don't know, how advance Python is and continuously evolving with the speed of light.
				Not sure I can keep up with this 'fast moving train'.

				<p>What did you know before this class?<br>
				 My understanding of databases was limited, and my SQL skills are basic. 
				 I knew databases were crucial for storing and managing data, and I had little experience with basic queries.
				</p>
				<p>What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class?<br>
				I gained hands on experience of pulling data base on parameters, understanding better structure and how to access and manipulate the results.
				I like the simple logic of SQL, hoping to learn more with practical implementation into other areas of analytics and reporting.

				aspects of marketing, as well as understanding the modern digital techniques used by businesses today.  
				I never worked in an area beyond designing flyers. </p>
				<p>
				What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class?
				I am learning about the foundation in marketing and how much goes into consideration on how best to 
				reach to buyer and point of not being aware of the product or service to the point of selling on to them.
